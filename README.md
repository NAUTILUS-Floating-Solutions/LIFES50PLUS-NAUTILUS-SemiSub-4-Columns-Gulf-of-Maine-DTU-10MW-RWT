# LIFES50+ NAUTILUS Semi-Sub Gulf of Maine Public Design with DTU 10MW Reference Wind Turbine

## Project structure
The `bin` directory contains the executables to run the model. The aeroelastic runs on FAST v8.16.00a-bjj (downloaded from https://www.nrel.gov/wind/nwtc/fastv8.html). The `Wind_fields` directory contains the input files for generating the full-field turbulent wind files. They run using TurbSim v150 (downloaded from https://www.nrel.gov/wind/nwtc/turbsim.html). Finally, the `DTU10MWRWT_NAUTILUS_GoM_FAST_v1.00` directory contains the aerolastic model and some of the simulation setups used in LIFES50+.

## Instructions to run the model
1.  The full-field turbulent files are generated by running the corresponing input file using `bin/TurbSim64.exe`.
2.  The FAST simulations on this repository run on `FAST_Win32.exe` or `FAST_Win32d.exe`, as the controller DLL used `dtu_we_controller_bladed.dll` is compiled as a 32-bit DLL.

To automate this process, an `allrun.py` file is provided to run all the TurbSim and FAST simulations in this repository.
